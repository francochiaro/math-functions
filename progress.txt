## Codebase Patterns
- Frontend uses Next.js 16 with App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS
- D3.js for all chart rendering and interactions
- Backend uses Python FastAPI for curve fitting API
- Geist font family for typography (sans and mono variants)
- Color scheme: zinc neutrals, green (#22c55e) for success/accents, indigo (#6366f1) for data points
- All state management done with React hooks (useState, useCallback, useRef)

# Progress Log

## 2026-01-17 - US-001 through US-015 (All Stories)
- **What was implemented:** Complete Interactive Curve Fitting Lab application
- **Files changed:**
  - Frontend:
    - `frontend/src/app/page.tsx` - Main application page with all UI
    - `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx` - App layout with metadata
    - `frontend/src/app/globals.css` - Design system and animations
    - `frontend/src/components/CartesianChart.tsx` - D3.js chart component
    - `frontend/src/hooks/useChartDimensions.ts` - Responsive chart sizing
    - `frontend/src/types/chart.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
  - Backend:
    - `backend/main.py` - FastAPI server with fitting endpoints
    - `backend/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

- **Features implemented:**
  1. 2D Cartesian chart with D3.js (axes, gridlines, dynamic ticks)
  2. Zoom and pan with mouse/trackpad
  3. Painting mode for adding points by clicking
  4. CSV upload with downsampling and validation
  5. 50,000 point limit enforcement
  6. Multi-model curve fitting (linear, polynomial, exponential, logarithmic, power, rational, spline, sinusoidal)
  7. Fitting objective selection (accuracy, interpretability, balanced)
  8. Automatic best model selection with heuristics
  9. Progress UI with step indicators and time estimate
  10. Fitted curve visualization with contrasting colors
  11. Statistics display (R², RMSE, MAE) with quality badges
  12. Analytical properties computation (derivatives, extrema, asymptotes)
  13. Integral computation with shaded area visualization
  14. Erase & Restart functionality
  15. World-class UI with modern design

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - D3.js zoom behavior needs manual bounds tracking for proper axis updates
  - Frontend includes fallback simulation when backend is unavailable
  - Backend uses scoring heuristics that vary by objective
